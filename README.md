## Code Design

Molli is a tool for people in cheminformatics to quickly and efficiently upload molecules into Python. Then, the molecules can be adjusted for visualization.

This is the repository for the documentation of molli. To generate this documentation yourself, the following is required. 

## Installation and Dependencies 

The documentation imports the molli code locally. Consequently, molli must already be installed to generate this documentation.
